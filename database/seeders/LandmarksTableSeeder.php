The original tower was rebuilt after it was destroyed by fire in 1280, and the second segment was added not long after. The octagonal lantern dates from the end of the 15th century and was initially crowned by a wooden spire. After having been burnt down twice, it was never rebuilt.&nbsp;</p><p>The tower is 83 metres high and is part of the Cloth Hall, the main marketplace for textiles and other goods during the Middle Ages. Visitors can take the 366 steps to the top for a panoramic view of the city. The Belfry houses, amongst other things, the treasury room and the carillon with 47 bells that can be heard all over the city.</p><p>The Belfry tower was the symbol of the autonomy and pride of the city and its inhabitants. Like in most cities of the Low Countries, it was used as a watchtower and a treasury where legal documents and trade privileges were preserved. Until 1769, new laws and important messages were read out to the people from the balcony above the entrance door.&nbsp;</p><p>The Belfry also served as a handy communication tool between the city and its inhabitants via the ringing of its bells. Each bell carried a distinct sound and function, notifying citizens of the time, the opening and closing of the city gates, important events or dangers such as wars or fire. As such, the Belfry hasn’t only been the pride and protector of our city, but has also provided the soundtrack for life in Bruges since the Middle Ages.</p>',

Together we led the revolt of Flemish insurgents against the attempts by our French lieges to annex Flanders and tax our growing wealth. The uprising resulted in the massacre of a French garrison stationed in Bruges in the early hours of the 18th of May, 1302, an event that would become known as the Matins of Bruges.&nbsp;</p><p>According to the tradition, to distinguish the French from the natives, anyone suspected to be French was obliged to repeat the phrase ‘<i>scilt ende vrient</i>’, meaning ‘shield and friend’ - a phrase that is hard to pronounce for French speakers. Those who were unable to properly pronounce the words got their heads bashed in with a <i>Goedendag</i>, or Good Day: a rudimentary weapon that consisted of a stick with a large metal pin. For the 120 Frenchies who came in close contact with it that morning, it didn’t turn out to be a very good day!</p><p>The French governor Jacques de Chatillon managed to escape the city dressed as a commoner and inform King Philip the Fair in Paris of the massacre that had taken place here. Infuriated, &nbsp;the king gathered an army of his finest knights and sent them off to Bruges to teach us a lesson. An alliance of Flemish forces, consisting mostly of foot soldiers, ambushed the French cavalry on a swampy field near the city of Courtrai and slaughtered the royal army at the Battle of the Golden Spurs on July 11, 1302. Even though we eventually lost the war, the battle has become a symbol for the Flemish strive for independence and the 11th of July is still celebrated every year as the Day of the Flemish Community.</p>',

Ships made their way from the North Sea to the nearby ports of Sluis or Damme, where goods were transferred onto small barges. From there, these barges could make it into Bruges via a small canal, passing underneath the low urban bridges until they reached the Water Hall in the commercial heart of the city. The Water Hall stood here from 1294 to 1787 and was replaced by the Provincial Palace a century later. In case you’re wondering what happened to the river, it continues to flow underneath the building today.&nbsp;</p><p>On the left side of the Provincial Palace is the <strong>Historium museum (link to Historium)</strong>, an immersive virtual experience that brings medieval Bruges back to life, including the old Water Hall.

It was installed in 1837 at the time when the railway line between Brussels and Bruges was being completed and there was a need to align the clocks in all Belgian train stations. For this reason, the exact meridian of 41 places in Belgium was determined by way of a sphere. At noon exactly, the sun’s shadow aligned with a small hole in the globe and fell upon a meridian line in the pavement. The line that was thus drawn can still be traced today thanks to a string of copper nails in the pavement. Of the 41 such devices that were used in Belgium, this is the last surviving one.</p>',

Before being allowed to practice the craft, one first had to learn the job as an apprentice and pass a master test. In this way, each guild kept a strict control over who was allowed to join their ranks. The guilds looked after the interests of their workers, arranged commercial disputes between members and fixed the salaries and the prices of their products. The guilds also offered a form of social security to their members by way of sick and poor care, and can thus be regarded as precursors to trade unions.&nbsp;</p><p>The guilds occupied many seats in the Flemish city councils, which made them extremely powerful. In my days, the count needed to have permission from the city councils of the three largest cities in Flanders - Bruges, Gent and Ypres - to make all kinds of decisions, even whom he was to marry. In this way, the guilds exerted a considerable influence on the governance of the entire county.&nbsp;</p><p>The guilds also played a prominent military role, as they provided the militias that formed the army of Flanders. They defended their economic and political privileges fiercely against anyone who opposed them, be it the count of Flanders or the king of France. This often resulted in large-scale protests or even armed conflict, like the <strong>Battle of the Golden Spurs (link to Statue of Jan Breydel and Pieter de Coninck)</strong> that was won by the militias of the Flemish guilds. All this made the guilds the effective rulers of Flanders and the defenders of the political and economic status quo all throughout the Middle Ages.&nbsp;</p><p>Many of the guild houses were lavishly decorated to express the wealth and power of the guild.

The Germans also made civilian casualties in Bruges, as did the British during bombardments of the city. The British air force bombed Bruges with approximately 6000 bombs during the war, which were dropped by hand and lacked accuracy. As a result, 125 civilians were killed and many houses were destroyed, though none of the major historical buildings were badly damaged.</p><p>During World War II, no significant battles were fought in Bruges and there were far less casualties compared to World War I, but it could have been very different. At the end of the war, in September 1944, while Canadian forces were approaching Bruges, the German Commanding Officer Immo Hopmann received the order from Berlin to open up fire on the Canadian soldiers. Immo Hopmann realised that if he were to do that, the historical centre of Bruges would be destroyed and many civilians would be killed. For that reason, he refused to carry out the order and thanks to his brave decision, the city was spared.</p>',

In fact, my family was so powerful that we were able to build our own private VIP chapel - for our Very Important Prayers - inside the <strong>Church of Our Lady (link to Church of Our Lady)</strong> with direct access to our bedroom.&nbsp;</p><p>It’s fair to say that I was the most famous member of my family. I was a businessman, military advisor, diplomat and patron of arts.

My slogan can be seen above the entrance: ‘Plus Est En Vous’, meaning ‘There is more in you’.&nbsp;</p><p>I kept close ties to the dukes of Burgundy and in 1461, I was knighted into the Order of the Golden Fleece. This order was established in Bruges in 1430 by Duke Philip the Good with the aim to defend the Catholic religion, uphold the values of knighthood and increase the prestige of the Burgundian dynasty. It became one of the most respected orders in Europe. Knights of the order discussed politics and war with the duke and could never be summoned before an ordinary court of law, which meant we were above the law.&nbsp;</p><p>The order has had many prominent members over the course of history, like the Holy Roman Emperor Charles V or the English King Henry VIII. The order is still in existence today and counts Queen Elizabeth II, Nicolas Sarkozy and King Felipe VI among its members. The symbol of the order is a golden ram suspended from a necklace. According to a Greek myth, the Trojan hero Jason captured the fleece from a fierce dragon. The ram supports the claim of the Burgundians to be descended from the Trojans. You’ll find it not only in the coat of arms of my family, but in many places around the city if you keep an eye out for it.</p><p>I ordered the construction of this beautiful palace in the 15th century.

The lamb with the flag is one of the symbols of the order and can be seen above the portal.&nbsp;</p><p>The hospital of Bruges is amongst the oldest and largest remaining ones in Europe and counts as a perfect prototype of a hospital in the Late Middle Ages. It initially consisted of a monastery and a couple of infirmaries, but kept on expanding for centuries to include a brewery, a graveyard, a pharmacy and several gardens and chapels. The hospital refers to <i>hospitalitas </i>or hospitality and was based on Christian charity, offering free care and shelter to pilgrims, the poor, the sick and the dying. The hospital was governed by the city, but the work was done by nuns and monks, like myself, on a voluntary basis.</p><p>In medieval times, spiritual care was considered much more important than physical care. Our primary task was to alleviate the souls of our patients and the hospital contained many chapels or altars devoted to saints who assisted in the healing process or the afterlife. For this reason, the hospital commissioned Hans Memling in 1489 to paint a shrine devoted to Saint Ursula, who protected school children from diseases. This masterpiece of Flemish art can still be found in the hospital museum today, along with several other paintings by Memling as well as many tools and instruments that were used here. Make sure to take a look inside if you have the chance!</p><p>Our community of monks and nuns also provided physical care, but we left more delicate tasks, like surgeries, amputations or the treatment of broken bones, to more specialised physicians. A popular way to treat illnesses in my days was via bloodletting, a procedure by which blood was withdrawn from a patient. For this practice, doctors required the help of barbers, not because they were the most skilled medics, but simply because they had the sharpest tools in town!</p><p>The hospital remained the principal care institution in Bruges until 1977, when a modern hospital was built outside the city walls and the medieval infirmaries were turned into a museum.</p>',

Especially in the overcrowded and polluted cities of Europe, such as Bruges, the disease spread like wildfire. The impact was devastating: from 1347 to 1350 between one third and one half of the European population, or about twenty million people, perished. Those who contracted the pest died a painful death within three days, and only few survived the infection. I was one of the lucky survivors.</p><p>My name is Rochus and I was born in Montpellier around the year 1300. I gave away all my possessions to the poor and travelled through Europe to take care of people suffering from the plague. Eventually I got infected myself and isolated myself deep inside the woods in order not to infect anyone else. Suffering from the disease alone in the woods, I couldn’t get the food I needed. Luckily for me, a dog came to visit every day. The dog picked up old pieces of bread from the streets in a nearby town and brought them to me. Thanks to my saviour on four legs, I was able to survive and even heal from the disease. That’s when I received the order from God to go back to my hometown.</p><p>Upon my arrival, the people of my hometown didn’t recognise me and my own uncle accused me of being a spy. I was arrested and locked up in prison, where I continued to take care of the sick. I died in my cell eight years later. In 1485, my relics were brought from Montpellier to Venice and since then I’ve been honoured as the patron saint of the sick, the imprisoned and the dogs. I was one of the four hundred saints that provided protection from the pest and you can still find our statues all over town. You can easily recognise mine: I’m a pilgrim with a hat and a staff and I’m pulling up my skirt to show the healed scars of the infection on my leg. On my side you can see my loyal dog with a piece of bread in its mouth. For centuries, people prayed to me to receive protection from this terrible disease.</p>',

Much of the charity work was done in the Saint John’s Hospital, taking care of the sick and dying, but we were also involved in other activities like weaving, brewing or copying religious texts.&nbsp;</p><p>As opposed to other monastic orders, beguines took temporary vows of obedience and chastity. Because we did not have to take full religious vows, we were allowed to keep personal belongings and switch back from a religious to a secular life. This meant that ladies could always turn to the beguinage in times of need and return to society when they were back on their feet. As such, the beguinage made a major contribution to the empowerment of women during the Middle Ages, which was not always well received by the patriarchy in Rome. During the 14th century, the Pope even condemned the order for heresy for some time.&nbsp;</p><p>Today, the site is no longer inhabited by beguines, but by sisters of the Order of Saint Benedict, who perform the daily services in the <strong>church (link to church)</strong>. Now governed by the city’s social services, the beguinage continues to support vulnerable women by providing housing to several unmarried ladies with low incomes. The beguinage of Bruges has been a UNESCO World Heritage Site since 1998 and counts as one of the best preserved.

She was taken to the hospital and died of internal bleedings at the <strong>Prince’s Court (link to Prince’s Court)</strong> two weeks later.</p><p>Our son Philip the Handsome was only four years old at the time and too young to take over power, so I was appointed regent of the Burgundian state until Philip was old enough to rule. Being the son of the German emperor and heir to both the Burgundian and Habsburgian territories, I was one of the most powerful men in Europe at the time. To secure my inheritance for myself and my son, I got involved in a series of conflicts with King Louis XI of France. To finance these wars, I had no other option but to increase taxes in my Burgundian territories, including the County of Flanders.</p><p>The rebellious and stubborn people of Bruges didn’t accept me as their ruler, and refused to pay higher taxes. In January 1488, they did the unthinkable. Upon entering the city, the people of Bruges closed the city gates behind me and took me hostage in the <strong>house of Craenenburg (link to Craenenburg)</strong> on the Market square. They tried to make a deal with me for months, but I refused to give in. Until my friend Pieter Lanchals, or Peter Longneck, who was the city administrator and one of my close advisors, was captured and brought onto the square. The bastards of Bruges tortured and executed Peter while I had to witness the whole scene from my prison cell. Eventually, I agreed to their terms and promised to renounce my regency over Flanders. They forced me to swear an oath not to punish the city and after four long months, I was finally released.</p><p>As soon as I was freed, I sought revenge. I gathered my troops outside the walls and besieged the city. When peace was finally made after years of conflict, I forced the people of Bruges to tear down their defense walls and banned all foreign merchants from the city. Bruges never fully recovered from this devastating blow. Meanwhile, the Zwin, the body of water connecting Bruges to the North Sea, had begun to silt and ships could no longer reach the city. To make matters worse, a crisis in the cloth industry resulted in less commercial activity while Bruges suffered from the competition of the bigger port of Antwerp. As Antwerp rose to become the main trading centre in the Low Countries, Bruges fell into decline. It wasn’t until the creation of the new harbour of Zeebrugge and the advent of tourism centuries later, that the economic revival could begin.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Still, that wasn’t enough for me and I had one final punishment in store for the rebellious people of Bruges. To commemorate the murder of my friend Peter Longneck, I obliged them to keep \'longnecks\' in the city for forever and three days. The locals have kept this promise by taking care of the swans, even though I didn’t keep my promise to them...</p>',

Much of the new architecture from that period was also carried out in a neo-Gothic style, including this bridge.

It is no coincidence that the bourse and the Venetian Lodge are located next to one another, because it was in Venice that modern banking and Western capitalism developed in the 13th century. In my days, thanks to the booming cloth industry, there were a lot of trading activities between the Flemish and the Italians, especially from Genoa, Venice and Florence, and their trading houses were located around this square.</p><p>As a salt trader, I paid with salt in exchange for coins or goods, which was common practice in the old days and gave origin to the word salary. Other products like tobacco leaves, copper or cloth were also accepted as currency. Trade was booming and merchants started to gather a lot of wealth, so we needed a place where we could safely store our wealth and have access to it whenever and wherever we needed. That’s how the first modern banks were created, most notably by the Medici family in my hometown of Florence, who early on established one of their <strong>main branches (link to Bladelin Court)</strong> here in Bruges.&nbsp;</p><p>Soon, traders began receiving a value paper, an IOU, as a proof of deposit. It wasn’t long before we would use these securities as money and started trading them with each other. This marked the start of paper money in Europe and the trading community in Bruges became one of the early adopters of this new financial instrument. This may very well explain why Bruges would become known as the Venice of the North: not simply because of its breath-taking beauty and its many canals, but primarily because the city was the financial centre of the north.</p><p>To regulate the trade in paper bonds and set the exchange rates, one of the world’s first exchange markets developed in Bruges. It was a tavern that belonged to the local Van der Buerse family and was frequented by both local and foreign traders. As a result, the family’s name is still used to denominate a stock exchange in many different languages: beurs, bourse, Börse, bolsa, birža. Countless foreign traders, all with their own customs, languages and currencies, came to the tavern to trade bills of exchange with each other, and every day a bell would mark the beginning and end of the trade activities. The original tavern dates back to 1285, the current building was constructed in 1453.</p>',

As the ferocious animal stood up on its back legs to attack him, Baldwin jumped forward with his lance and pierced the bear to a tree.&nbsp;</p><p>Back in Bruges, the story of his heroic behaviour circulated quickly. When he was inaugurated as the first margrave of Flanders, the people of Bruges donated a carved, upright bear to him, which has since become the symbol of the city.

Nowadays it’s impossible to compare both, since the church in Jerusalem was destroyed by a fire in the 16th century.</p><p>During the construction of this church, the family also included a replica of the tomb of Jesus Christ. Legend has it that when the builders attempted to place the cover stone on the replica of the Holy Grave, the stone cracked in half. A year later, when they tried it a second time with a new stone, it cracked again in exactly the same way. It was at that moment that the family decided to travel back to Jerusalem to take another look at the Holy Grave. When they arrived on site, they were amazed to see that the same crack also featured on the original stone.</p><p>I don’t know if this story is true or not, but I do know for a fact that members of the Adornes family travelled to the Holy Land twice in a short period of time. Historical records of those journeys have been preserved and the top of the church still carries the cross of Jerusalem. The church has always remained private property in the hands of the same family, which saved it from the destruction caused by religious revolts. The church is part of a museum and is definitely worth a visit.</p>',

If you look closely at my statue, you might see I am actually standing on an old water pump instead of an ordinary pedestal. Odd no? That’s because for five hundred years this square was home to a giant meat hall, until it was taken down in the early 19th century. The meat hall was the biggest slaughterhouse of the city. Can you imagine the looks of the place? Not to mention the smell?</p><p>So let’s tell you a little bit about myself. I was born in Bruges in 1548 and I turned out to be a pretty good mathematician. I started out my career as an accountant, but I had many other fields of interest, like hydraulic engineering, architecture, urban planning, music theory, linguistics, navigation, physics and astrology. Yes, you can say I was quite the homo universalis. At the age of 33, I moved from Bruges to Leiden to study mathematical sciences. During my studies I met the Dutch Prince Maurits of Nassau, who hired me as his tutor and counsellor.</p><p>As a scientist, I improved many techniques and invented some cool things, like the sail wagon I designed for the prince. The one I am most famous for is my simplification of calculations with fractions by adding a decimal sign, which is either a point or a comma. This means that without me, you wouldn’t be able to count the way you do today. My work inspired Thomas Jefferson to introduce a decimal currency and is the reason why Americans are still paying in dimes today. I died in 1620 as one of the greatest scientists of my time.</p><p>The square that carries my name is an enjoyable place to sit down and have a drink or eat something. To most people, it is known for The Chocolate Line: a world famous chocolate shop with the most creative and bizarre flavour combinations. Have you ever tried white chocolate with basil, sun-dried tomato and olive chutney; almond pralines with fried onions; or milk chocolates with crispy bacon and quinoa? Now is your chance! The man behind this chocolate shop, Dominique Persoone, has been praised as the number one chocolatier in the world and, if you ask me, deserves a statue of his own.</p>',

There, the goods were loaded onto smaller barges and transported to Bruges via a small canal. Daily products like sardines, wine or salt, but also many fine goods and luxury products made their way to the city via this route. Over time, the silting up of the Zwin was one of the major causes of the economic decline of Bruges.&nbsp;</p><p>The Langerei largely follows the trajectory of the original river Reie through the city.

As a protected settlement with a direct link to the North Sea, Bruges rapidly developed into a prominent international trading port, importing wool from England and exporting fine Flemish cloth to all corners of the continent. The city quickly grew rich and crowded as a result of its thriving cloth industry and favourable geographic position.</p><p>This development also defined the city’s social structure, as about half the population consisted of weavers, fullers, dyers or wool shavers. They were the backbone of the booming economy, but had to live in rather poor conditions. Most of the wealth and power was controlled by the nobility, who solidified their position by making agreements and privileges that were kept in the treasury room of our <strong>Belfry (link to Belfry and Cloth Hall)</strong>.&nbsp;</p><p>The growing influence of the newly emerging trading elite inevitably brought them into conflict with the established aristocracy and their lord, the count of Flanders.

The incident sparked a huge political crisis and forced the French King Louis VI to intervene. He had 27 conspirators responsible for the murder thrown from the highest tower of the Burg square and readily made use of the power vacuum to try to expand his influence over Flanders.&nbsp;</p><p>The people of Bruges quickly realised they needed better protection and began to build fortifications around the city, encircling it with moats, earthen walls and wooden palisades. The wooden fortification was later replaced by a stone construction and the only remnant of this first defence wall is the semi-circular guard tower visible across the canal. The moats that were dug in the weeks following the assassination still form part of the inner canals of the city today.</p><p>Bruges continued to grow to such an extent that by the end of the 13th century, new <strong>ramparts (link to City walls)</strong> were needed.
